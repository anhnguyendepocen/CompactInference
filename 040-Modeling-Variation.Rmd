# Modeling variation

## Statistical model

A function that turns inputs into an output. The inputs are values for the explanatory variables, the output is a value for the response variable. 

## Model values

And the variance of the model values, $v_m$.

## Probability as the model output

For categorical response variables, the output is between zero and one and is interpreted as a probability or proportion.

## Degrees of flexibility

Show some models of increasing flexibility

- continuous explanatory variable
- categorical variable with multiple levels

## Too much explanation

Show how the model exactly reproduces the response variable when there are sufficient degrees of freedom.

## Indicator variables

How to change a categorical variable with any number of levels into a set of simple 0/1 variables.

## Model vectors, linear combinations, and degrees of flexibility

Count the model vectors. Discard any that are linear combinations of the others.
