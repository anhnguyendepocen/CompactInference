Many statistical claims are made in terms of an effect size. For instance, according to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), wearing seat belts reduces the risk of fatal injury to passenger-vehicle occupants by about 50%. This is an effect size.1 But this related fact from NHTSA is not an effect size: 51% of male passenger-vehicle occupants killed in 2017 were not wearing seat belts. An effect size summarizes a comparison between two different conditions. In the first example, those two conditions are 1) wearing a seat belt and 2) not wearing a seat belt. In the second example, however, there is just one condition: being a male passenger-vehicle occupant who died in a car accident in 2017.2 7.1 Slopes and differences Consider two models introduced in Chapter 5. Figure 5.1 shows child’s height versus mother’s height in Galton’s data. The straight-line model shows a slight upward slope. To calculate the effect size of child’s height with respect to mother’s height, pick two values of mother’s height: say 60 and 68 inches. From the graph you can read the output of the model at these two values of the input. At an input of 60 inches, the output is 65.5 inches. At an input of 68 inches, the output is (coincidentally) 68 inches. The effect size is the slope of the model: rise over run. Here, the “run” is 68 - 60 = 8 inches. The “rise” is 68 - 65.5 = 2.5 inches. So the slope is 2.5 / 8 = 0.31. The model in Figure 5.1 has a quantitative explanatory variable: mother’s height. In constrast, the model in Figure 5.2 has a categorical explanatory variable: pollen shape. To calculate an effect size with respect to pollen shape in Figure 5.2, follow much the same procedure. First, pick the two input levels you want to compare. Here, there are only two levels possible: long and round shapes. Next, look up the model output at each of the two inputs. The output of the model is framed as a probability. The probability of a white flower is 24% for long pollen, and 25% for round pollen. Since the explanatory variable is categorical, it doesn’t mean much to look at the numerical difference in the input. The model output, on the other hand, is quantitative (as it is for all the models we consider in this book). The effect size is 25% - 24% = 1 percentage point. To recap, when the explanatory variable is quantitative, the effect size is stated as a slope: change in output divided by change in input. When the explanatory variable is categorical, the effect size can be stated as a difference. 7.2 Risk In the previous paragraph, I say “can be stated as a difference” because there are other ways often used to compare the model output between two different levels of a categorical explanatory variable. For instance, when the output is interpreted as a “risk,” the two outputs might be compared as a ratio, called the risk ratio. It sounds odd when talking about flower color, but if we were thinking about the “risk” that a pea plant’s flowers are white, then it would be appropriate to consider the effect size with respect to pollen shape as the ratio 25% / 24% = 1.04. Note that this 1.04 is not in percent. When writing about risk ratios, people often use percentage terms. The risk ratio of 1.04 might be described, “The risk of a white flower increases by 4 percent.” Were the risk ratio smaller than 1, say 0.87, we would speak of a risk decrease: “The risk of a white flower is 13% lower for ….” It’s potentially confusing for us to report differences of risk in “percentage points” and ratios of risk as “percent.” Not everyone is sensitive to the distinction between “percentage points” and “percent.” Perhaps it would be helpful to report differences as an absolute change in risk while ratios are a relative change in risk. There’s yet another way used to describe changes in risk: the odds ratio. Odds are a different format for describing risk. If the probability of an outcome is \\(p\\), the odds are \\(p/(1-p)\\). So, the odds of a white flower in a plant which has round pollen is \\(0.25/(1-0.25) = 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3\\). The use of odds, and its cousin, log odds, is a genuine help when working with models with multiple explanatory variables. 7.3 Simple changes in input I’m using the word “simple” to refer to the change in input involved in an effect size. Several considerations motivate this: When looking at a categorical explanatory variable, and effect size is a comparison of just two of the levels. When looking at a quantitative explanatory variable, I advocate using a finite change in input, e.g. the 60 inches to 68 inches in mother’s height. That’s simpler than the alternative, using an infinitesimal change in input, and more appropriate for many machine-learning models where the output can vary discontinuously as the input changes. But the main thing I want to emphasize with the word “simple” has to do with models with multiple explanatory variables. In such models, there are different effect sizes for the different explanatory variables. That is, an effect size reports the change in model output when a single explanatory variable is changed, holding all the others constant. This is where the phrase “with respect to” comes into play. For instance, the model displayed in Figure 4 of Chapter 6, with child’s height as the response variable, involves three explanatory variables: mother’s height, father’s height, and child’s sex. An effect size in such a model refers to a specific explanatory variable. So it’s meaningful to speak of the effect (on child’s height) with respect to mother’s height, or the effect with respect to father’s height, or the effect with respect to child’s sex. Which one is right for you depends on what you are investigating. I’m using “about” here since we haven’t yet introduced confidence intervals. That will happen in Chapter 9. It took some work to chase down the confidence intervals on the relative risk of fatal injury: it is 40% to 60%.↩ What to call a descriptive quantity like 51%. It’s not an effect size. One word used is “statistic,” which is simply a number calculated from data. But “statistic” has other meanings as well. An effect size is also a statistic. I suggest simply using “proportion” for the 51%. Chapter 11 looks at confidence intervals on means and proportions. The confidence interval for the 51% proportion is 50-52%.↩ "]
